## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this website was chosen mainly for accessibility purposes and is kept to a simple black and white theme to ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the background and any text used on the website - as can be seen below via Adobe Color. The only other colour on the website comes from the images.

### Typography

The fonts used for this website are 'DM Serif Display' for the headings and 'DM Sans' for all other text - as paired by fontpair.co and imported via Google Fonts, with 'serif' and 'sans-serif' set as fallback fonts respectively.

### Imagery

The imagery for this website was sourced mainly from pexels.com (with exception of the homepage hero image sourced from unsplash.com). The images were chosen specifically to have an editorial aesthetic - meaning that the images were to look as though they had jumped from the pages of a magazine or a campaign photoshoot to give the look and feel of high quality production by Seventeen Agency. The images were all compressed using tinypng.com.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this website were created using Balsamiq.com. Originally, as seen in the wireframes below, the design was set to include a logo consisting of a black circle enclosing the number '17' in place of the heading 'Seventeen Agency'. This logo was scrapped for the final version of the website and was kept only as the favicon. This change was made partly due to aesthetic purposes and because the heading of 'Seventeen Agency' conveyed more clearly the purpose of the website as opposed to a circular logo with just a number inside of it. 

The website consists of four pages in total, the Home page, the About page, the Portfolio page and the Contact page. In the original designs for the website, this was set to include three pages only, with the homepage acting as the portfolio page also so that visitors could see immediately the type of work that the agency produced. However, this was changed to include a landing page with a singular hero image and informative heading which, when clicked, takes the user to the 'About' page. This design decision was made to make the website easier to navigate and made more sense for the user to visit the 'About' page first to learn more about Seventeen Agency and then move onto the 'Portfolio' page to see previous works.
