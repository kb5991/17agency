## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this website was chosen mainly for accessibility purposes and is kept to a simple black and white theme to ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the background and any text used on the website - as can be seen below via Adobe Color. The only other colour on the website comes from the images.

### Typography

The fonts used for this website are 'DM Serif Display' for the headings and 'DM Sans' for all other text - as paired by fontpair.co and imported via Google Fonts, with 'serif' and 'sans-serif' set as fallback fonts respectively.

### Imagery

The imagery for this website was sourced mainly from pexels.com (with exception of the homepage hero image sourced from unsplash.com). The images were chosen specifically to have an editorial aesthetic - meaning that the images were to look as though they had jumped from the pages of a magazine or a campaign photoshoot to give the look and feel of high quality production by Seventeen Agency. The images were all compressed using tinypng.com.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this website were created using Balsamiq.com. Originally, as seen in the wireframes below, the design was set to include a logo consisting of a black circle enclosing the number '17' in place of the heading 'Seventeen Agency'. This logo was scrapped for the final version of the website and was kept only as the favicon. This change was made partly due to aesthetic purposes and because the heading of 'Seventeen Agency' conveyed more clearly the purpose of the website as opposed to a circular logo with just a number inside of it. 

The website consists of five pages in total, the Home page, the About page, the Portfolio page, the Contact page and finally, the Thank You page which users are redirected to upon completion of the contact form. In the original designs for the website, this was set to include three pages only, with the homepage acting as the portfolio page also so that visitors could see immediately the type of work that the agency produced. However, this was changed to include a landing page with a singular hero image and informative heading which, when clicked, takes the user to the 'About' page. This design decision was made to make the website easier to navigate and made more sense for the user to visit the 'About' page first to learn more about Seventeen Agency and then move onto the 'Portfolio' page to see previous works.

## Features

### Header and navbar

The navbar for this website is situated at the top of each page, with the name of the business positioned to the left and all navigational elements set to the right. This is set to be the same on all size devices with the navigational elements collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. The page being viewed is underlined with the other page titles showing as underlined upon mouse hover. The business logo when tapped/clicked takes the user back to the homepage.

### Landing/Homepage 

The landing page boasts an aesthetic, high quality, fashion photograph - showcasing the agency's work upon the first visit to the the website. This image, along with the single across the image helps the user to understand the type of quality and services on offer by Seventeen Agency. The landing image and text when clicked/tapped will take the user to the website's 'About' page.

### About page

The about page features the agency's main goals and initiatives, the services and talent they provide and inviting potential clients to collaborate with them. Complementary images are used to break up the text and bring colour to the page.

### Portfolio page

The portfolio page features the high quality work produced by the agency, to show current and potential clients what they can expect from Seventeen Agency upon working with the business. The page has been designed to work responsively, with 5 columns of imagery on laptops and desktops, down to 3 columns on tablets, and a singular column on phones.

### Contact page

The contact page features a striking background image with an overlayed form allowing the user to contact the agency with any enquiries. All fields in the form are required and will flag a warning if any are missed or if the email address is entered incorrectly. Upon completion, the form will take the user to the 'Thank You' page.

### Thank You page

Upon clicking the submit form on the contact page, the user is redirected to the 'Thank You' page with further information on when they can expect a response to their enquiry or, alternative means of communication via the agency's social media pages.

### Future Implemenations

In the future I would like to improve the performance of the website as some of the imagery in particular is known to slow down the loading speed of the website despite initial and further compression. I would also like to implement a feature where the images in the portfolio can have captions with names of the particular talent - whether they were a fashion stylist or a hair and makeup artist for example, who contributed to that particular campaign/shoot and links to their own portfolio pages for clients to see and choose who they wish to work with.

### Accessibility

Aria labels have been used consistently on all pages as well as alt text on images for ease of use for screen readers and for any broken image links. I have also included fallback fonts should the specified fonts fail to load as well as semantic elements for easy navigation.
